======

I'm supposed to write some stuff here to demonstrate how a commit works. 
I guess a commit is an edit.
You can later view what edits were made when and by whom.
No sneaky business possible here.
<b> Do these kinds of tags work? </b>
I'm talking about the bold that I'm hoping appeared above after I put a b inside some pointy brackets.
That's how this shit works, right?

<p>Here's another edit</p>
<i>And some more code</i>
<a>Trying random letters in brackets</a>
<e>Wonder what these do</e>
